        <h1>Speech Outlining & Delivery Mechanics</h1>
        
        <h2>BIG IDEA</h2>
        <p>The transition from a <strong>Preparation Outline</strong> (full sentences) to a <strong>Presentation/Speaking Outline</strong> (notecards) is essential for <strong>extemporaneous delivery</strong>. Effective public speaking relies on a structured hierarchy—Introduction, Body, and Conclusion—where the speaker is prepared enough to be dynamic without reading a manuscript.</p>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            <strong>Timing Warning:</strong> The parameter for this speech is 2 to 4 minutes. You will see time cards. If you see the "4" or a top time card, do not panic or abandon your speech. You have 30 seconds to wrap up without reduction. <strong>The conclusion is worth more points than a time deduction.</strong> Never skip the conclusion to save time; abbreviate it if necessary, but finish it.
        </div>

        <h2>KEY TERMS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-step">Preparation Outline:</span> A detailed, full-sentence outline including everything you plan to say, labeled by part (Intro, Body, Conclusion). This is turned in for a grade.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Presentation Outline:</span> Your speaking notes (notecards or one sheet). These are abbreviated and not collected by the professor.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Extemporaneous Speaking:</span> Delivery that is prepared and practiced but not memorized or read. It allows for "dynamicism"—adjusting to audience reactions or time constraints.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Subordinate Points:</span> Ideas that work "under" a main point. They must directly serve, explain, or prove the point above them.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Transitions:</span> Logical bridges between points (e.g., "Not only does it reflect my workplace, but also my preferences").</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS/PROCESS: OUTLINING & PREP</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Write the Body First:</strong> The Introduction and Conclusion are reflections of the Body. Establish your main points (Roman Numerals) before writing the "hooks."</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Main Point Sentences:</strong> Treat these as topic sentences. You should have 2 or 3 reasons/points. Avoid having 5 or more for a 4-minute speech.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop Sub-points:</strong> Provide specific examples and elaborations. This is where you prove your main point and share unique information about yourself.</li>
            <li><strong>Create the Presentation Outline:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use notecards (recommended) or one sheet of paper.</li>
                    <li><strong>DO NOT</strong> cut up your full outline and glue it to cards.</li>
                    <li>Write big enough to glance down and see.</li>
                    <li>Use one card per section (Intro, Point 1, Point 2, Conclusion).</li>
                    <li>Number the cards so they don't get mixed up.</li>
                    <li>Avoid writing on the back of cards to prevent confusion.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            <strong>The "No Reading" Rule:</strong> If you bring your full outline to the podium, you will read it. If you have it perfectly written, you won't be able to resist. The key is to have enough to be helpful, but not so much that you read word-for-word.
        </div>

        <h2>RULES/IDENTITIES: THE INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Element</th>
                <th>Rule</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Attention Grabber (Hook)</strong></td>
                <td>MUST be first. Do not say your name or "Hi" first. Strategies: Shock value, Comedy (self-deprecating), Surprising facts, Quotes, Questions (Rhetorical or Participative).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Thesis</strong></td>
                <td>The basic statement of your main idea (e.g., "I am like a dry erase marker").</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Preview</strong></td>
                <td>The roadmap. Specifically mentions the main points you will cover in the order you will cover them.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2>EXAMPLE 1: The Instructor's "Dry Erase Marker" Speech</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Hook:</strong> Asks about classroom staples (chalkboards vs. smartboards) and the "screechy sounds" of old tech.</p>
            <p><strong>Thesis/Preview:</strong> "Today, I want to talk about why I'm like a dry erase board and marker... because it reflects my workplace and my preferences for technology."</p>
            <p><strong>Point 1 (Workplace):</strong> Community college speaker for 7 years (5 at FayTech). Interacts with whiteboards every day; it's part of the identity of a teacher.</p>
            <p><strong>Point 2 (Technology):</strong> Prefers hard copies over ebooks; likes to highlight/print. Right in the middle: not a smartboard (too fancy), but not a chalkboard (too old).</p>
            <p><strong>Summary/Clincher:</strong> Re-summarizes the two points. Ends with a challenge: "Next time you walk into a classroom, see what you represent. Is it a pencil or a pen?"</p>
        </div>

        <h2>EXAMPLE 2: Selecting an Object</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The object is a vehicle to learn about <em>you</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Bad Example:</strong> Talking for 3 minutes about how refrigerators work because you are in the refrigeration program. (Too much focus on object, not enough on person).</li>
                <li><strong>Cliché Warning:</strong> Trees/Roots. Everyone says they have roots in family. Try to find something unique that couldn't be written by anyone else.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>PRACTICE PROBLEMS: SELF-CHECK</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Does my attention grabber relate to my content, or is it just a random loud noise?</li>
            <li>If I remove the "labeling" (A, B, C) from my outline, do I have organized paragraphs or a mess?</li>
            <li>Do my sub-points (A, B) actually support the main point directly above them?</li>
            <li>Am I prepared to speak if something happens 2 days before the speech? (Extemporaneous style allows for updates).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>Public speaking follows the slogan: <strong>"Tell me what you're going to tell me (Preview), tell me (Body), and tell me what you told me (Summary)."</strong> Use the outline template provided on Canvas to ensure all parts (Intro, Preview, Transitions, Body, Summary, Clincher) are included. The grade for the outline and the speech are separate; a good outline is the foundation for a good speech.</p>
