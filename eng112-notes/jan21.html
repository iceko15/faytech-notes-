        <h1>Comparative Analysis & Genre Structures</h1>
        
        <h2>BIG IDEA</h2>
        <p>The primary focus of this session is the <strong>Comparison Analysis Chart</strong> located in Module 1. This assignment requires students to contrast a humanities-based literary excerpt with a technical science article, focusing on structural language, referencing styles, and disciplinary conventions.</p>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            <strong>Professor's Warning:</strong> Don't get bogged down in the technical data of the science article. You don't necessarily need to read the whole thing word-for-word because it contains ratios, charts, and complex data. Focus on understanding the general intent and structure to complete the analysis chart.
        </div>

        <h2>KEY TERMS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structural Language:</strong> The specific vocabulary and phrasing used to organize an argument within a specific discipline.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparative Analysis Chart:</strong> The required deliverable for the week where students map out differences between the two assigned readings.</li>
            <li><strong>Fatex Alerts:</strong> The college notification system for weather-related closures and emergencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS/PROCESS</h2>
        <p class="key-step">1. Review the Disciplines Overview</p>
        <p>Ensure you have reviewed the PowerPoint covering the different academic disciplines and how they communicate.</p>

        <p class="key-step">2. Read Article A: Humanities/Literary</p>
        <p>Read "On Writing" by Stephen King. This is an excerpt from his book. It is considered a humanities article and is generally easier to read than technical prose. Look for connections to modern writing contexts despite it being published around 2000.</p>

        <p class="key-step">3. Read Article B: Science/Technical</p>
        <p>Review "Writing about Past Failures Attenuates All the Resources." This is a science article containing ratios and charts. Skimming is recommended for the highly technical data sections, but a general understanding of the study's goal is necessary.</p>

        <p class="key-step">4. Complete the Comparative Analysis Chart</p>
        <p>Using the articles and the PowerPoint on structural language and references, fill out the chart. This chart is due at the end of the week (Sunday).</p>

        <h2>RULES/IDENTITIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> The Comparative Analysis Chart is due by Sunday.</li>
            <li><strong>Quiz:</strong> There is a quiz scheduled for this coming Sunday.</li>
            <li><strong>Late Policy:</strong> No penalties are applied for submissions within 7 days of the deadline.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Contingency:</strong> If the college shuts down (due to "Snowpocalypse 2026" or ice), follow the schedule but stay alert to power outages. If power goes out, the instructor is not worried about immediate deadlines.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            <strong>Pro-Tip for Success:</strong> A quarter-inch of ice is enough to take down power lines. Work ahead of the Sunday deadline this week to avoid "panic mode" if the predicted winter storm causes power outages.
        </div>

        <h2>EXAMPLE 1: Comparative Reading Strategy</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Humanities (King):</strong> Focus on the narrative voice and structural language. Even though it is over 25 years old, look for how King’s advice applies to today's writing environment.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Science (Failures Article):</strong> Focus on the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion. Skim the ratios and complex data charts unless they are needed to explain the "reference" section of your analysis chart.
        </div>

        <h2>PRACTICE PROBLEMS</h2>
        <p>While reading, students should be able to answer the following based on the Module 1 PowerPoint:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the specific <strong>structural language</strong> used in the King essay vs. the science article?</li>
            <li>How does the <strong>referencing style</strong> differ between a book excerpt and a peer-reviewed science study?</li>
            <li>What are the <strong>structural markers</strong> that help you navigate the science article more quickly?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>Students should spent 20-30 minutes glancing at the two articles in class in preperation for a discussion. The focus is on the <strong>structural language, reference, and overall structure</strong>. Ensure you have signed the attendance sheet and are signed up for Faytech's Alerts in case of ice-related campus closures. The Comparative Analysis Chart and the quiz are both due Sunday.</p>
