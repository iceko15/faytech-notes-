        <h1>Module 2: The Humanities Module</h1>
        
        <h2>BIG IDEA</h2>
        <p>The Humanities Module centers on the analysis of literature and film to understand the "timeless" aspects of human behavior and morality. Through Nathaniel Hawthorne's 19th-century short story <i>The Birthmark</i>, we explore how historical literature remains relevant to modern stigmas, sexuality, and the desire for perfection. The goal is to move beyond simple summary toward deep, original <b>literary analysis</b>.</p>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            <strong>Warning on Reading Formats:</strong> The version of <i>The Birthmark</i> attached in the class module is not a PDF. If you look for the text elsewhere (since it is in the public domain), ensure it is the <b>complete, un-altered version</b>. Many online versions are shorter or modified. Because it was published in the 1800s and has no copyright, people often alter the text. 
        </div>

        <h2>KEY TERMS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key-step">Open-Ended Question:</span> A question that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no." It requires thought, interpretation, and discussion (e.g., "Why did the character make this choice?").</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Literary Analysis:</span> The process of examining, interpreting, or evaluating a work of literature to find deeper meaning rather than just summarizing plot points.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Literary Criticism:</span> A formal, professional response to a work of literature, often written by scholars, using specific styles and conventions.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Catharsis:</span> An old Greek term referring to the emotional release an audience experiences through film or literature (e.g., crying when a character or dog dies).</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Themes:</span> Recurring ideas in a work that indicate the meaning of the human experience.</li>
            <li><span class="key-step">Foreshadowing:</span> Hints or clues provided by the author about what will happen later in the narrative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>LITERARY ANALYSIS PROCESS</h2>
        <p>The instructor emphasizes that there is no single "right" answer in literature, though there can be "wrong" answers if the student hasn't read the text or is making things up. The focus is on <b>original interpretation</b>.</p>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>The "Dr. A" Methodology for Analysis:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Read at least twice:</b> The first read-through is for the basic narrative. The second is for detail and insight.</li>
                <li><b>Take Notes:</b> Mark recurring ideas (themes) and symbolic imagery.</li>
                <li><b>Contextualize Vocabulary:</b> Look up dated 19th-century words, but try to understand them through the sentence context first. Mastery is knowing how to use the word, not just memorizing the definition.</li>
                <li><b>Avoid AI:</b> The instructor warns that AI-generated analysis is often at a "graduate level" that is easily distinguishable from undergraduate work. Using it deprives the student of original thought.</li>
            </ol>

            <strong>Drafting & Feedback Policy:</strong> The instructor will <b>not</b> review drafts via email. To get feedback, you must:
            <ul>
                <li>Attend the optional in-class peer review day (bring a printed draft).</li>
                <li>Visit the instructor during office hours for a 10-15 minute "skimming" review.</li>
                <li>Go to the Writing Center for a full session with a tutor familiar with the assignment.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>ANALYSIS EXAMPLE: THE "TITANIC" DEBATE</h2>
        <p>The class discussed the "door" scene in James Cameron's <i>Titanic</i> (1997) as an exercise in analyzing <b>author/director choices</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Question:</b> Why couldn't Jack fit on the door?</li>
            <li><b>The Analysis:</b> It wasn't about physical space; it was a symbolic choice. The director chose to kill off the character to fulfill the "tragic, dramatic love story" theme. </li>
            <li><b>The Conclusion:</b> If they had both lived, gotten married, and eventually divorced, it wouldn't be a "long-lost love" epic. The sacrifice makes the narrative romantic and memorable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>UPCOMING CITATION STYLES</h2>
        <p>The course will move through multiple citation formats depending on the module:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>MLA:</b> Used for the current Humanities/Literature module. (8th/9th edition).</li>
            <li><b>APA:</b> Will be used for the upcoming Natural Sciences and Social Sciences modules. The professor will spend more time teaching this as it is usually new to students.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>For the next month, all work will center on <i>The Birthmark</i> by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Students must focus on identifying literary elements (foreshadowing, imagery, symbolism) and preparing for a verbal discussion. The instructor emphasizes "originality over correctness"—the goal is to see how your unique worldview allows you to interpret the text.</p>
