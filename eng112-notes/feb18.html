        <h1>Literary Analysis: The Birthmark</h1>
        
        <h2>BIG IDEA</h2>
        <p>The transition from general rhetorical analysis to literary analysis requires a shift in focus from "how an ad works" to "how literary elements create meaning" within a text. We are specifically examining Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Birthmark" to construct a formal analysis, while managing two distinct upcoming assignments that use the same primary text but different methodologies.</p>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            Professor's Warning: Do not confuse the current Literary Analysis essay with the upcoming Literary Criticism response. They are both about "The Birthmark," but they are two different assignments. The Literary Criticism response (due March 6th) requires integrating a secondary source, which is a different type of analysis.
        </div>

        <h2>KEY TERMS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Literary Analysis:</strong> A different "animal" than 111-level analysis; it involves interpreting themes, symbols, and character motivations rather than just rhetorical strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Works Cited:</strong> A mandatory page listing the sources used in the essay, formatted according to MLA standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Source:</strong> An outside academic source used to support an argument (required for the March 6th assignment, not the current one).</li>
            <li><strong>False Spring:</strong> A North Carolina weather phenomenon discussed at the end of class, characterized by temporary warm weather before winter returns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>STEPS/PROCESS</h2>
        <p class="key-step">1. Essay Development</p>
        <p>You have until next Wednesday for the final draft. Use this time to refine your analysis of the characters (Aylmer, Georgiana, Aminadab) and the central conflict regarding perfection and nature.</p>
        
        <p class="key-step">2. Works Cited Setup</p>
        <p>If you are unsure how to format the Works Cited, access the resources provided on Canvas. It is essential for avoiding plagiarism and providing credit to Hawthorne's text.</p>

        <p class="key-step">3. Peer Review/Drafting</p>
        <p>Next week, bring your draft to class. The more people who bring drafts, the more opportunities we have to exchange and provide feedback. You can print it out in class or email it to yourself to print here.</p>

        <h2>RULES/IDENTITIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> No work is strictly due "this week" due to the pushed-back deadline.</li>
            <li><strong>Submission:</strong> The final draft is due next Wednesday.</li>
            <li><strong>Literary Criticism Response:</strong> Due March 6th. This builds on the current essay by adding a secondary source.</li>
            <li><strong>Transition:</strong> After the "The Birthmark" assignments, the class will move into the Natural Sciences unit with a new set of assignments.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="prof-tip">
            Professor's Tip: If you just came out of ENG-111, you've done analysis (ads, rhetorical forms), but literary analysis is its own unique skill. Take the time to understand the requirements in detail now so you don't get confused later.
        </div>

        <h2>EXAMPLE 1: Organizing the Essay</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            The professor noted that students should be looking at the requirements in detail. A good draft should already be in progress, focusing on the specific prompts provided in the assignment description on Canvas.
        </div>

        <h2>EXAMPLE 2: Integrating Sources</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            For the current assignment, focus on the primary text ("The Birthmark"). For the next assignment (due March 6), you will practice a different type of skill: integrating a secondary source into your existing analysis.
        </div>

        <h2>EXAMPLE 3: Managing the Workload</h2>
        <div class="example-box">
            The due date was pushed back to allow for more time on the final draft. Use the "break" this week to refine the work rather than ignoring it.
        </div>

        <h2>PRACTICE PROBLEMS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Draft a Works Cited entry for Hawthorne's "The Birthmark."</li>
            <li>Identify one symbol in the story and write a paragraph explaining how it contributes to the theme of "science vs. nature."</li>
            <li>Prepare your draft for the peer exchange happening in the next class session.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>This session served as a workshop and clarification period. The deadline for the "Birthmark" essay has been extended to next Wednesday. The instructor emphasized the difference between the current literary analysis and the upcoming literary criticism task. Students are encouraged to bring physical or digital drafts next week for a peer exchange. Finally, the class concluded with a brief anecdote about the "seasons of North Carolina" and the professor's past experience in the Army and doing tree work.</p>
